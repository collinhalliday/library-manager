# Library Database Management System

An app that allows users to interact with and manipulate a small library's database.

This project was done in conjunction with my TeamTreehouse full-stack JavaScript TechDegree, as the 10th project of twelve. I was given HTML and CSS starter files, a small database file including a few library books, patrons and loans, and mockups of the app's desired appearance. I was then instructed to convert the static HTML to dynamic pug templates, to program all of the app's functionality, including routing, input validations, dynamic page display, and communication with and manipulation of the database. This app uses Node.js, Express, the template engine pug and the ORM Sequelize.

The app also includes some pagination and search functionality as part of the project's extra credit.

## Installation:

With npm and node.js installed on your computer and the project files downloaded, use `npm install` to download all of the project's dependencies.

## Usage:

Use `npm start` to run the app with the development server on port 3000. The app's root/home page can then be accessed at the following url: http://localhost:3000
